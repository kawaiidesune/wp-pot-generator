# WP POT Generator
This is a command line tool inspired by [Laravel Installer](https://github.com/laravel/installer) to generate [.pot files](https://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers#POT_files) for WordPress themes and plugins. To use it, you need [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) on your system.
